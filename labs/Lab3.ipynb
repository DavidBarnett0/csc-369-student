    "One of the variables available to you in a databricks notebook is the <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.html#:~:text=Main%20entry%20point%20for%20Spark,before%20creating%20a%20new%20one.\">Spark Context</a> (``sc``). This context allows us to interact with a Spark cluster you have started. Databricks handles all of this in the background. The string we pass has an important portion: \"dbfs\". This tells Spark we are going to load a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next portion to consider is flatMap. \n",
    "\n",
    "> PySpark flatMap() is a transformation operation that flattens the RDD/DataFrame (array/map DataFrame columns) after applying the function on every element and returns a new PySpark RDD/DataFrame. In this article, you will learn the syntax and usage of the PySpark flatMap() with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://sparkbyexamples.com/pyspark/pyspark-flatmap-transformation/\n",
    "\n",
    "So flatMap is going to act as our \"for\" loop and run the first anonymous function on each line. Pretty reasonable that this is a split. Each line ``x`` is a Python string, and we map it to a list of strings using split. So what about the next line that call ``map``. Why map and not flatMap?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The difference is that the map operation produces one output value for each input value, whereas the flatMap operation produces an arbitrary number (zero or more) values for each input value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need flatMap at first because we are mapping one line to many outputs. We just need map for the second because we are changing a string to a tuple consisting of a string and the integer value of 1. Example: ('the',1). This is perhaps one of the least intuitive steps. Why 1? And why a tuple? The tuple is because we have entered a key-value functional programming paradigm. The key is very important because the data will be shuffled according to this key. In other words, all items with the same key will be grouped together. This is important because we want to count the words, so if we make the key equal to the word, then we can sum them up. The 1 is important because this is the value in the key value. We are going to sum or add up the values to get the total count. Thus the anonymous function inside of the map call returns a key and a value. We then reduce these groups that are organized by keys (our words) and then add up all the values. This is what the final line ``reduceByKey(add)`` does for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, just because we defined counts doesn't mean it actually runs. We need to collect the data in order for it to be executed. This line runs and collects the output:\n",
